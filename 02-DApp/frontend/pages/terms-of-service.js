      <p>
        Unless otherwise indicated in writing by us, the Site and Services, all
        content and other materials contained therein, including without
        limitation, our logos, and all designs, text, graphics, pictures,
        information, data, software, sound files, other files, and the selection

        names, logos, or slogans that may appear on the Services or somewhere
        else are property of TeamDiff and may not be copied, imitated or used,
        in whole or in part, without our prior written permission. In addition,
        the look and feel of the Site Content, including without limitation, all

        voxel other versions of TeamDiff Collectibles are all the intellectual
        property of TeamDiff.
      </p>
      <p>
        None of the TeamDiff Collectible content is meant to confer any
        additional benefit to the owner of the TeamDiff Collectible. Neither
        TeamDiff or any third party has any obligation to provide any additional
        benefit, and neither TeamDiff or any third party will have any
        responsibility or liability for, arising out of, or relating to any
        additional benefits
      </p>
      <h2 style={underline}>4. TeamDiff Collectibles</h2>
      <p>
        You represent and warrant that any purchase of a TeamDiff Collectible by
        you is solely for your personal collection, use and enjoyment, and not
        for speculative or investment purposes, for use as a substitute for
        currency or other medium of exchange.
      </p>
      <p>
        You acknowledge and understand that by purchasing a TeamDiff Collectible
        you are not acquiring any equity or other ownership or profit-sharing
        interest in TeamDiff, or any of its affiliates or any brand or other
        business venture.
      </p>
      <p>
        LEGISLATIVE OR REGULATORY CHANGES AT THE STATE, FEDERAL OR INTERNATIONAL
        LEVEL MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE USE, TRANSFER, OR EXCHANGE OF THE
        TEAMDIFF COLLECTIBLES.
      </p>
      <h2 style={underline}>
        5. TeamDiff Collectibles Purchased Through Third Party Platforms
      </h2>
      <p>
        TeamDiff Collectibles can only be purchased through third party
        platforms (for example, OpenSea) (the “Third Party Platform”). You will
        be required to create an account with the Third Party Platform and by
        doing so, you are agreeing to comply with their terms of service.
        TeamDiff will have no liability to you or to any third party for any
        claims or damages that may arise as a result of any transactions or
        services hosted by these Third Party Platforms.
      </p>
      <h2 style={underline}>6. TeamDiff Collectibles Purchased through Site</h2>
      <p>
        We do not offer a hosted digital wallet on the Services. You will be
        required to link a supported blockchain-based digital wallet (“Supported
        Wallet”) provided by supported third-party unhosted wallet providers
        (“Supported Wallet Provider”). By connecting your Supported Wallet and
        minting an NFT with our smart contract you have purchased a TeamDiff
        Collectible. We will deliver any TeamDiff Collectibles that you purchase
        from us directly to your Supported Wallet and you will be responsible
        for safekeeping the passwords and keys associated with your Supported
        Wallet. We will not be able to recover purchased TeamDiff Collectibles
        for you in the event that you lose access to your Supported Wallet
        account or under any other circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each Supported Wallet Provider is a third-party company that offers
        unhosted digital wallet products and services. We are not in any way
        affiliated or partnered with Supported Wallet Providers. Your use of
        each Supported Wallet Provider’s products and services is subject to its
        applicable terms of service. We will not be liable to you for any loss
        that results from your use of a Supported Wallet Provider’s products and
        services, including Supported Wallets.
      </p>
      <p>
        All pricing and payment terms are as set forth on the Services, and any
        payment obligations you incur are binding at the time of purchase. All
        sales are final. Unless otherwise required by applicable law, we will
        not provide a refund on any purchase.
      </p>
      <h2 style={underline}>7. Linking Your Supported Wallet</h2>
      <p>
        When you link your Supported Wallet, you understand and agree that you
        are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your Supported
        Wallet and your control over any Supported Wallet-related authentication
        credentials, private or public cryptocurrency keys, non-fungible tokens
        or cryptocurrencies that are stored in or are accessible through your
        Supported Wallet. Any unauthorized access to your Supported Wallet by
        third parties could result in the loss or theft of TeamDiff Collectibles
        and/or funds held in your wallet and any associated wallets, including
        any linked financial information such as bank account(s) or credit
        card(s). We are not responsible for managing and maintaining the
        security of your Supported Wallet nor for any unauthorized access to or
        use of your Supported Wallet. If you notice any unauthorized or
        suspicious activity in your Supported Wallet that seems to be related to
        the Services, please notify us immediately.
      </p>
      <h2 style={underline}>8. Payment</h2>
      <p>
        Pricing for TeamDiff Collectibles is variable. The TeamDiff Collectibles
        called “MEV Legion Banners” themselves are zero (0) dollars, but
        purchasers are required to pay a transaction fee (“Gas Fees”) for every
        transaction that occurs. Gas Fees fund the network of computers that run
        the decentralized Ethereum network. The value of the Gas Fee changes,
        often unpredictably, and is entirely outside of the control of TeamDiff.
        The purchaser acknowledges that under no circumstances will a contract,
        agreement, offer, sale, bid, or other transaction regarding TeamDiff
        Collectibles be invalidated, revocable, retractable, or otherwise
        unenforceable on the basis that the Gas Fees were unknown, too high, or
        otherwise unacceptable to the purchase. The purchaser also acknowledges
        and agrees that Gas Fees are non-refundable under all circumstances.
      </p>
      <h2 style={underline}>9. Terms of Sale</h2>
      <p>
        By placing an order on the Site, you agree that you are submitting a
        binding offer to purchase a TeamDiff Collectible. If you are the initial
        purchaser of the TeamDiff Collectible then all amounts due are to be
        paid to TeamDiff. If you are not the initial purchaser, then amounts are
        to be paid to the-then holder of the TeamDiff Collectible. You also
        acknowledge and agree that TeamDiff receives 0-10% of every subsequent
        sale of a TeamDiff Collectible (“Royalty”) depending on the TeamDiff
        Collectible. TeamDiff has the right to collect Royalties for TeamDiff
        Collectible sales in perpetuity and may use those funds in any manner
        TeamDiff sees fit.
      </p>
      <p style={underline}>
        As such, if you sell a TeamDiff Collectible on a third-party NFT
        marketplace, you agree to include a statement substantially similar to
        the following in the description of the NFT:
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“0-10% Royalty Applies. See TeamDiff Terms for details.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, when you buy or sell a TeamDiff Collectible on this Site,
        you agree to pay all applicable fees associated with the transaction and
        you authorize TeamDiff to automatically charge and collect such fees
        from your payment. We will always display a breakdown of any transaction
        or other fees prior to your purchase or sale of a TeamDiff Collectible.
      </p>
      <p>
        No refunds are permitted except with respect to any statutory warranties
        or guaranties that cannot be excluded or limited by law.
      </p>
      <h2 style={underline}>10. Risks</h2>
      <p>
        Please note the following risks in accessing, purchasing, selling or
        using TeamDiff Collectibles: The price and liquidity of blockchain
        assets, including TeamDiff Collectibles, are extremely volatile and may
        be subject to large fluctuations. Fluctuations in the price of other
        digital assets could materially and adversely affect TeamDiff
        Collectibles, which may also be subject to significant price volatility.
        Legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the state, federal, or
        international level may adversely affect the use, transfer, exchange,
        and value of TeamDiff Collectibles. TeamDiff Collectibles are not legal
        tender and are not backed by any government. Transactions in TeamDiff
        Collectibles may be irreversible, and, accordingly, losses due to
        fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable. Some
        transactions in TeamDiff Collectibles shall be deemed to be made when
        recorded on a public ledger, which is not necessarily the date or time
        that you initiated the transaction. The value of TeamDiff Collectibles
        may be derived from the continued willingness of market participants to
        exchange fiat currency or digital assets for TeamDiff Collectibles,
        which may result in the potential for permanent and total loss of value
        of a particular TeamDiff Collectible should the market for that TeamDiff
        Collectible disappear.
      </p>
      <p>
        You agree and understand that you are solely responsible for determining
        the nature, potential value, suitability, and appropriateness of these
        risks for yourself, and that we do not give advice or recommendations
        regarding TeamDiff Collectibles, including the suitability and
        appropriateness of, and investment strategies for, TeamDiff
        Collectibles. You agree and understand that you access and use the
        Services at your own risk; however, these statements do not disclose all
        of the risks associated with TeamDiff Collectibles and other digital
        assets. You agree and understand that we will not be responsible for any
        communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you
        may experience when using TeamDiff Collectibles however caused.
      </p>
      <h2 style={underline}>11. No Guarantees or Future Promises</h2>
      <p>
        TeamDiff hopes to put out more content and create things in the future.
        When you purchase your TeamDiff Collectible you agree that your purchase
        from our launch is all you are guaranteed to receive in exchange for
        your funds. Whether through primary or secondary channels, the art is
        what you receive. Any future benefits are ancillary to this purchase and
        not to be taken into consideration with your initial purchase. You agree
        that you are not relying on any future commitments by TeamDiff.
      </p>
      <h2 style={underline}>
        12. TeamDiff Collectibles Are Not Intended as Investments
      </h2>
      <p>
        TeamDiff Collectibles are meant to be a NFT for you to collect. They are
        not meant as investment vehicles. We make absolutely no promise or
        guarantee that these NFT’s will be worth anything more than what you and
        the market deem the art to be worth. This could very well be zero.
        TeamDiff Collectibles have no inherent monetary value, and should be
        treated as nothing more than a collectible
      </p>
      <h2 style={underline}>13. Taxes</h2>
      <p>
        You are entirely responsible for any tax liability which may arise from
        minting or reselling your TeamDiff Collectible.
      </p>
      <h2 style={underline}>14. Disclaimers</h2>
      <p>
        THE SERVICES AND ANY SITE CONTENT CONTAINED THEREIN, AND ANY AND ALL
        TeamDiff COLLECTIBLES LISTED THEREIN ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS
        AVAILABLE” BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER
        EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. TeamDiff (AND ITS SUPPLIERS) MAKE NO WARRANTY THAT
        THE SERVICES AND ANY TeamDiff COLLECTIBLES WILL (1) MEET YOUR
        REQUIREMENTS; (2) BE AVAILABLE ON AN UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, OR
        ERROR-FREE BASIS; OR (3) BE ACCURATE, RELIABLE, COMPLETE, LEGAL, OR
        SAFE.
      </p>
      <p>
        WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF ANY KIND FROM ANY ACTION TAKEN OR
        TAKEN IN RELIANCE ON MATERIAL OR INFORMATION, CONTAINED ON THE SERVICES.
        TeamDiff DOES NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT SITE CONTENT IS ACCURATE,
        COMPLETE, RELIABLE, CURRENT OR ERROR-FREE.
      </p>
      <p>
        WHILE WE ATTEMPT TO MAKE YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SERVICES AND SITE
        CONTENT SAFE, WE CANNOT AND DO NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT THE
        SERVICES, SITE CONTENT, ANY TeamDiff COLLECTIBLES LISTED ON OUR SERVICES
        OR OUR SERVERS ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS. WE
        CANNOT GUARANTEE THE SECURITY OF ANY DATA THAT YOU DISCLOSE ONLINE. YOU
        ACCEPT THE INHERENT SECURITY RISKS OF PROVIDING INFORMATION AND DEALING
        ONLINE OVER THE INTERNET AND WILL NOT HOLD US RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY BREACH
        OF SECURITY.
      </p>
      <p>
        WE WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY LOSS AND TAKE NO
        RESPONSIBILITY FOR, AND WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR, ANY USE OF
        TeamDiff COLLECTIBLES INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY LOSSES, DAMAGES
        OR CLAIMS ARISING FROM: (A) USER ERROR SUCH AS FORGOTTEN PASSWORDS,
        INCORRECTLY CONSTRUCTED TRANSACTIONS, OR MISTYPED ADDRESSES; (B) SERVER
        FAILURE OR DATA LOSS; (C) CORRUPTED WALLET FILES; (D) UNAUTHORIZED
        ACCESS TO APPLICATIONS; AND/OR (E) ANY UNAUTHORIZED THIRD PARTY
        ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE USE OF VIRUSES, PHISHING,
        BRUTE FORCING OR OTHER MEANS OF ATTACK AGAINST THE SERVICES OR TeamDiff
        COLLECTIBLES.
      </p>
      <p>
        TeamDiff COLLECTIBLES ARE INTANGIBLE DIGITAL ASSETS. THEY EXIST ONLY BY
        VIRTUE OF THE OWNERSHIP RECORD MAINTAINED IN THE ETHEREUM NETWORK. ANY
        TRANSFER OF TITLE THAT MIGHT OCCUR IN ANY UNIQUE DIGITAL ASSET OCCURS ON
        THE DECENTRALIZED LEDGER WITHIN THE ETHEREUM PLATFORM. WE DO NOT
        GUARANTEE THAT TeamDiff CAN AFFECT THE TRANSFER OF TITLE OR RIGHT IN ANY
        TeamDiff COLLECTIBLES.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are not responsible for sustained casualties due to vulnerability or
        any kind of failure, abnormal behavior of software (e.g., wallet, smart
        contract), blockchains or any other features of the TeamDiff
        Collectibles. TeamDiff is not responsible for casualties due to late
        report by developers or representatives (or no report at all) of any
        issues with the blockchain supporting TeamDiff Collectibles including
        forks, technical node issues or any other issues having fund losses as a
        result.
      </p>
      <p>
        The TeamDiff Collectibles are transferable blockchain-based non-fungible
        tokens that evidence a limited license to TeamDiff Collectibles, and, in
        some cases, a limited license to third-party content and/or to access
        additional benefits, that is exclusive to the owner and thereby
        collectible as a form of alienable digital property. Unlike
        cryptocurrencies and other fungible digital assets, non-fungible tokens
        are not used to make payments. Non-fungible tokens are not mutually
        interchangeable and cannot be divided into smaller parts. These design
        features limit the usefulness of non-fungible tokens as a form of
        payment or substitute for currency. Instead, non-fungible tokens are
        enjoyed as digital collectibles
      </p>
      <p>
        Nothing in these Terms shall exclude or limit liability of either party
        for fraud, death or bodily injury caused by negligence, violation of
        laws, or any other activity that cannot be limited or excluded by
        legitimate means. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF
        IMPLIED WARRANTIES IN CONTRACTS WITH CONSUMERS, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION
        MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
      </p>
      <h2 style={underline}>15. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL TeamDiff BE
        LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY LOST PROFIT OR ANY INDIRECT,
        CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES
        ARISING FROM THESE TERMS, THE SERVICES, SITE CONTENT, TeamDiff
        COLLECTIBLES, OR THIRD PARTY SITES AND PRODUCTS, OR FOR ANY DAMAGES
        RELATED TO LOSS OF REVENUE, LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF BUSINESS OR
        ANTICIPATED SAVINGS, LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF GOODWILL, OR LOSS OF DATA,
        WHETHER CAUSED BY TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), BREACH OF CONTRACT, OR
        OTHERWISE, EVEN IF FORESEEABLE AND EVEN IF TeamDiff HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
        THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. ACCESS TO, AND USE OF, THE SERVICES,
        SITE CONTENT, OR THIRD PARTY SITES AND PRODUCTS ARE AT YOUR OWN
        DISCRETION AND RISK, AND YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE
        TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR MOBILE DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA RESULTING
        THEREFROM.
      </p>
      <p>
        NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED HEREIN, IN NO EVENT
        SHALL THE MAXIMUM AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF TeamDiff ARISING OUT OF OR IN
        ANY WAY RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE
        SERVICES, SITE CONTENT, AND/OR TeamDiff COLLECTIBLE EXCEED THE GREATER
        OF (A) $100 OR (B) THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID TO TeamDiff FOR THE SERVICES
        IN THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS OUT OF WHICH LIABILITY AROSE.
      </p>
      <h2 style={underline}>16. Indemnification</h2>
      <p>
        To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you will indemnify,
        defend and hold harmless TeamDiff and our subsidiaries and affiliates,
        and each of our respective officers, directors, agents, partners and
        employees from and against any third party losses, liabilities, claims,
        demands, damages, expenses or costs arising out of or related to your
        access to or use of our Services
      </p>
      <h2 style={underline}>17. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</h2>
      <p>
        Carefully read the following arbitration agreement ("Arbitration
        Agreement"). It requires you to arbitrate disputes with TeamDiff and
        limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us.
      </p>
      <p>
        Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. You agree that any dispute or
        claim relating in any way to your access or use of the Site, to any
        Services sold or distributed through the Site, including TeamDiff
        Collectibles, or to any aspect of your relationship with TeamDiff will
        be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that
        (1) you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify;
        and (2) you or TeamDiff may seek equitable relief in court for
        infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as
        trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and
        patents).
      </p>
      <p>
        Arbitration Rules and Forum.The Federal Arbitration Act governs the
        interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. The
        arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative
        dispute resolution provider. Disputes involving claims and counterclaims
        under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys’ fees and interest, shall be
        subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration
        Rules and procedures available at
        http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/; all other claims
        shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Comprehensive
        Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at
        http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/.JAMS’s rules are
        also available at jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267. If
        JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an
        alternative arbitral forum. If the arbitrator finds that you cannot
        afford to pay JAMS’s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees
        and cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS, TeamDiff will pay them for you.
        You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or video
        conference or based on written submissions, or you may request to meet
        in-person for arbitration in New York, NY. You agree that any judgment
        on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of
        competent jurisdiction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Authority of Arbitrator. The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority
        to (a) determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration
        Agreement and (b) resolve any dispute related to the interpretation,
        applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement
        including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this
        Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitration will decide
        the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and TeamDiff. The arbitration
        proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined
        with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority
        to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief
        available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s
        rules, and the Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement). The
        arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision
        describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is
        based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator
        has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a
        judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final
        and binding upon you and us. And you agree that to the extent monetary
        or non-monetary remedy or relief is granted, such request for relief may
        be enforced as needed by any court of competent jurisdiction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND TeamDiff HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL
        AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A
        JUDGE OR A JURY. You and TeamDiff are instead electing that all claims
        and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration
        Agreement, except as otherwise indicated in this Section 17 An
        arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief
        as a court and must follow this Arbitration Agreement as a court would.
        However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of
        an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.
      </p>
      <p>
        Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief. ALL CLAIMS AND
        DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE
        ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A OR COLLECTIVE CLASS
        BASIS, ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE
        CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY
        OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If a decision is issued stating that applicable
        law precludes enforcement of any part of this subsection’s limitations
        as to a given claim for relief, then that claim must be severed from the
        arbitration and brought in the state or federal courts located in the
        State of New York. All other claims shall be arbitrated.
      </p>
      <h2 style={underline}>18. Release</h2>
      <p>
        To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you release TeamDiff
        and the other TeamDiff parties from responsibility, liability, claims,
        demands and/or damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and
        nature, known and unknown (including, but not limited to, claims of
        negligence), arising out of or related to:
      </p>
      <p>a. Disputes between users,</p>
      <p>b. Acts or omissions of third parties, or</p>
      <p>
        c. Anything else for which you have agreed that TeamDiff will have no
        responsibility or liability pursuant to these Terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are a consumer who resides in California, you hereby waive your
        rights under California Civil Code § 1542, which provides: “A general
        release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party
        does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of
        executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have
        materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released
        party.”
      </p>
      <h2 style={underline}>19. Modifying and Termination our Services</h2>
      <p>
        We reserve the right to modify our Services or to suspend or stop
        providing all or portions of our Services at any time. You also have the
        right to stop using our Services at any time. We are not responsible for
        any loss or harm related to your inability to access or use our
        Services.
      </p>
      <h2 style={underline}>20. Governing Law</h2>
      <p>
        These Terms, your rights and obligations, and all actions contemplated
        by, arising out of or related to these Terms shall be governed by the
        laws of the State of New York, as if these Terms are a contract wholly
        entered into and wholly performed within the State of New York. YOU
        UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES SHALL BE DEEMED TO
        HAVE OCCURRED IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK AND BE SUBJECT TO THE INTERNAL
        LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD TO ITS CONFLICTS OF LAWS
        PROVISIONS.
      </p>
      <h2 style={underline}>21. Severability</h2>
      <p>
        If any provision or part of a provision of these Terms is unlawful, void
        or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed
        severable from these Terms and does not affect the validity and
        enforceability of any remaining provisions.
